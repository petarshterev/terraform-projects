# Terraform projects

In this repo I will gradually showcase some Terraform projects related to AWS infrastructure with different levels of complexity and AWS-related services used. Some of these AWS setups may be related to other projects (e.g. microservices deployed with Helm charts in Kubernetes clusters), so check the readmes for more information.
